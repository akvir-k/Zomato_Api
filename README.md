# Zomato_Api
I made a website of Zomaot API with used ReactJs and NodeJs.

## FrontEnd
   For Front end page I used Reactjs. Reactjs Library is very powerfull library to help to create 
    a beautiful website. It is very easy to use.
### Requirement of ReactJs
   first we need to install React library in our specific folder.
    you can use ``` create-react-app```.
    React install all dependecies at installation time so we don't need react dependicies again
    we need to install axios because with axios module we can connect my front end the Backend
    ``` npm install axios```  
    
## BackEnd
   I made backend with the help of express Framework. Express is a Framework of NodeJs. 
   I used Zomato Api connection to in this project.
   I create a connection file of Zomato Api and call directly to main Zomato ApI.
   I used Cors in backend. Cors helps to connect front and with backend.
## Install Dependencies
      npm install cors
      npm install body-parser
      npm install express
      npm install zomato
  we need to install these dependencies from our folder 
  
# Requirements of Machine
##Installation process and Execution
First, If you'are using Linux-based-OS, open your terminal and install the latest version of ***NodeJS and npm.***  You do also need to install mysql database onto your system. by writing the following commands.
This will install NodeJS version-12 and npm version-6 on your system.
